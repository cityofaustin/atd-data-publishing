TODO
- data inventory

HISTORY
- replace keys::
    - removed delete unmatched option
    - use reduce dict instead for that
- knack.update_record expects a string, no longer a list
- knack.update_record expects app_id and api_key
- change all datefields in all datesets to datetime
- change all lat/lon fields in all datasets to location_latitude
- verify that 'location' field exists in all datasets
- update all dashboards with location_ x
- get agol_fields from dataset! and do change detection!
- location names have leading spaces (data tracker issue)
- now specifiy date fields AND get date fields with: date_fields = [kn.fields[f]['label'] for f in kn.fields if kn.fields[f]['type'] in ['date_time', 'date']]
- manually set id_outfield to KNACK_ID or update datasets
- emailutil.send_email(ALERTS_DISTRIBUTION, 'Location Update Failure', str(e), EMAIL['user'], EMAIL['password'])
